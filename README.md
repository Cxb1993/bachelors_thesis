# Bachelor's thesis

This bachelor's thesis was written as part of my undergrad program Engineering Science at the Technical University of Munich. The thesis was supervised by Niklas Fehn at the Institute for Computational Mechanics.

The GIF shows a demo of a turbulent flow (at Reynolds number Re = 5540) over a backward facing step. This simulation was computed at one of the institutes's cluster using 64 nodes with 16 cores per node.
